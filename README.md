# Python
A few scripts written in python for fun, to learn and to help others learn.

**Calculus Animations:** Some working scripts in python to illustrate dimensions in the real world.

**Deep Learning:** Some tutorials, practice and implementation of ML models

- Projects: 
  - Millenium Classification: Given a song from any decade, classify which century it is from
  - Fortune Teller: Given 3 words, the model will guess what your next word will be with 82% accuracy
  - Vising: Given some shoes, classify whether two given shoes form a pair (Right foot shoe and left foot shoe also matters!) 
  
**Machine Learning** Implementation of different ML Models (from scratch)

- Projects: 
  - Assignment 1: Numpy basics, vectorized code, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbours algorithm (KNN)
  - Assignment 2: Polynomial Regression, K-Fold Cross Validation, Naive bayes, Linear & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Gradient & Stochastic Gradient descent,           Neural networks
  - Assignment 3: Principal Component Analysis, Bootstrap methods, Ensemble learning, K-Means Clustering
